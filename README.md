# Eurocard 3U/160mm KiCad Template

You can find information on where to drop this in the [KiCad documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/8.0/en/kicad/kicad.html#template-locations). 

This design is for:

* 4 layer PCB
* Design constraints for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com).
* Controlled impedance targeting 50&ohm; for single-ended and 90&ohm; for differential.
* [JLC04161H-7628](https://jlcpcb.com/impedance) stackup.
* Some general best-practices for net classes, trace, and via dimensions.
